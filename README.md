# submodular_opt
Submodular Optimization

### File Structure:

 - src/:  contians source files
 - main.m: the main file to run different experiments

## Usage:

See the setup guide inside the main file "main.m" to run different
experiments.


### Dependencies:

 - This implementation uses the quadprogIP solver provided by  [quadprogIP](https://github.com/xiawei918/quadprogIP), the MATLAB LP solver [linprog](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/linprog.html) and the
 MATLAB quadratic programming solver [quadprog](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/quadprog.html).

 - Additionally, the quadprogIP solver requires the Matlab interface to
 CPLEX 12.2 or later.
